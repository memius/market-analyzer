pg's definition of tokens:

``A Plan for Spam'' uses a very simple definition of a token. Letters,
digits, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs are constituent
characters, and everything else is a token separator. I also ignored
case.

Now I have a more complicated definition of a token: Case is
preserved.

Exclamation points are constituent characters.

Periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two
digits. This lets me get ip addresses and prices intact.

A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens, $20 and $25.


you should do this with the title:
Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines,
or within urls, get marked accordingly. E.g. ``foo'' in the Subject
line becomes ``Subject*foo''. (The asterisk could be any character you
don't allow as a constituent.)


pg recognizes about 200K tokens.

when you see something new, check if there is something similar already (you see Free!! and already have FREE!!).

if a token occurs only in one corpus, give it .0002 or .9998. if it occurs
more than e.g. 10 times, give it .0001 or .9999. you may want to scale much more than this two-step scale.

instead of using the 15 most interesting, you could use all tokens that are, say < .01 or > .99.
